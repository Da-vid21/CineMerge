## New App Ideas - APP EVALUATION CRITERIA

1.  Collabrative Movie Watch List App
    - **Description**: An app where a user can create a folder based on movie genre, favorite actor/actress and can add movies from different streaming services into one folder. Users can also collabrate with friends or the public to put a list for a movie night or movie suggestions in general
    - **Catagory** : Entertainment
    - **Mobile**: An app makes it easier to share a movie straight from streaming apps without needing to copy link and putting back to the website
     
    * **Story**: Allows for users to create a watch list from multiple movie subsctiptions and share with friends to collabreate and grow the list
    * **Market**: Anyone who watchs movies and needs suggestions can share what they want on the folder and even put in reddit threads, group chats to get suggestions from the public
    * **Habit**:  User or invited users add movies they are interested in watching then can later check off the movie they watched
    * **Scope**: First start off with a offline version where only users can add movies and is saved to their device but later add a database and accounts so that collabration is possible for second version of the app

1.  Workout Catalog
    * **Description**: The convinience of having it on the go. You can be at the gym or anywhere else and have the workouts at hand anytime, anywhere. 
    * **Mobile**: UI that is super user friendly so you won't waste anytime getting that workout done. A gamification element where there will be an XP progression setting that could make working out feel like you're in a video game.
    * **Category**: Health
    * **Story**: This is targeted to the fitness audience. There are always either beginners looking for guidance or others looking for new workouts or a better way to organize their workout. This could also target those people who find working out to be boring, or lazy people.
    * **Market**: Since a lot of people workout, whether its at home, at a gym, or somewhere else, a big chunk of people like exercising, so this would prove helpful for everyone. It is very competetive as there are many other apps, so theres that. But not all of those apps will have what this app brings to the table.
    * **Habit**: It is not an app that I imagine would be opened all day by one person, but rather it would be opened throughout the day by different people who will start an exercise or organize their workouts, maybe even just to learn about the exercises. The XP feature could make wokring out interesting among the users hopefully enticing them to do it more often.
    * **Scope**: This will be rather interesting building the app. A lot of it I learned in class so I could use those aspects and use an API I can find to provide the different workouts and images. Most of the fun would be in designing the UI and making it user friendly, yet entricate enough to keep users attention. The XP feature might be challenging.
